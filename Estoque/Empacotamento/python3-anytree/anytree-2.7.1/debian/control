Description: Tree data library
 ewer versions of gtk-doc-tools require anytree for gtkdoc-mkhtml2, an
 experimental replacement for gtkdoc-mkhtml and gtkdoc-fixxref which speeds
 up processing by transforming Docbook into HTML in Python code instead of
 using XSLT.
 For now I've replaced its use in gtk-doc-tools with a simple
 reimplementation (it's a tree data structure, it isn't rocket science),
 but in the long term either someone should package anytree, or someone
 needs to ask the upstream maintainer of gtk-doc to use a different tree
 implementation instead of depending on anytree (in which case this bug
 can be closed as wontfix).
